## What Was Preserved

### Still Relevant
- Transport abstraction patterns
- Codegen workflow
- Router adaptor system
- Observable pattern
- Testing strategies
- Development commands

### Marked as Legacy
- Pathfinding-specific algorithms
- D3.js visualization details
- Petgraph usage

### Kept for Reference
- `pathfinder-core/` examples show the pattern
- Architecture docs demonstrate the design
- Examples in `src/examples/` still work

## Documentation Philosophy

1. **Editor-First**: Primary documentation focuses on editor features
2. **Patterns Preserved**: Transport-agnostic patterns still documented
3. **Legacy Marked**: Pathfinding code marked but kept as reference
4. **Comprehensive**: New docs cover all editor features in depth
5. **Practical**: Step-by-step guides with complete examples
